The myths aren't real but the lessons are real. All Christians trying to be nice and explain are trying to say that basically the stories are real and also have the lesson, I disagree because the myths are not to be taken literally but the lessons are important. Christianity offers something that is not offered in Buddhism, something to hang on to which creates basically a hope that can mix in with all of the hopes for a better world in every person regardless of religion. There is more than one right answer. 

Hope itself is the action after we are done interpreting, getting up in the am for work, laughing, falling in love, these are actions of hope. Buddhism offers the idea that you are not permanent and no, there is no heaven, heaven or hell is here and now and it oscillates from second to second in our mind and only until we let go of all ego will we find peace and heaven. God, Jesus, Buddha are also simply egos of the universe we created in the same exact way we interpret us having an individual self, a set of hand-picked memories explaining who we are, we create an ego on the universe explaining the meaning of the universe. When you let go off holding on to the myth, you simply are left with the truth, the lesson and you make music in my opinion.")
