Hope itself is the action after we are done interpreting, getting up in the am for work, laughing, falling in love, these are actions of hope. Buddhism offers the idea that you are not permanent and no, there is no heaven, heaven or hell is here and now and it oscillates from second to second in our mind and only until we let go of all ego will we find peace and heaven. God, Jesus, Buddha are also simply egos of the universe we created in the same exact way we interpret us having an individual self, a set of hand-picked memories explaining who we are, we create an ego on the universe explaining the meaning of the universe.
