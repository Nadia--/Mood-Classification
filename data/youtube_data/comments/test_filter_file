The three worn words that had been passed between the woman's mother and father could have been 'I love you', however some seem to interpret that the syllable passed that created the girl may have had something to do with sin. Perhaps not only was the girl a product of sin but perhaps her current situation was also the result of sin. Furthermore, the woman could have died as women often did from ingesting harmful concoctions in order to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy. I'm not sure, after all this is just my interpretation. Either way it was a beautiful piece of art.\", \"My favorite shot in this video is probably when the dog hesitates in the doorway.
