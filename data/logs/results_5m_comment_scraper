A song that is soul consoling and I thank you, for these lyrics..
3 Van Morrison is simply unmatched in his music....
4 It's poetry put to music.  I am always proud to be from Belfast, but even more so, when I listen to Van.
5 Van has always been & always will be one of the greatest song writers & singers of all time !! He always sings from the soul !!

0 Jamaica used to  make  such beautiful music
1 "By other people standards, the instruments may sound distorted, the balance way off, but its just these rough edges that give reggae the raw sound that can never be copy abroad"
2 vocally, Jacob Killa Milla still has NO COMPARISON
3 Real talent.....Real reggae music. Forward ever and a backward never!

14 Nice glimpse of Mr. Music himself--Lee Perry. And what a great ear Jacob Miller had!
15 This was when Jamaica had great musicians making very great music. Now it's just hype and nastiness taking over the place .

7 Is it just me who wants to transpose this so they can play it without a piano
8 This is My favourite music rap
0 My God , a really great song
1 Beautiful masterpiece, absolutely brilliant talent, top of the line solid gold standard of excellence for over 50 years, Paul is a musical genius, magnificent career
2 This song really showcases his singing skills, as a vocalist myself he is where I draw a lot of my inspiration from (as well as Matthew Bellamy and Freddie Mercury of course!)
3 always, anywhere, anytime, anyhow, anyway.
up ur nose with a piano. lol
4 What an astonishing vocal performance from Paul.
5 I like too much this song... OMG
6 Whether or not partly meaningless lyrics, my home city Budapest is clearly mentioned. Thanks for sharing.
7 Thanks nowhereman for taking the time to compile what i consider pure platinum music. Cheers mate!
8 This is one of my favorite !!!Never could understand what is all about but music, beat and voice  are amazing.
9 Great song and a very good album underrated the time it has been released.
10 The lyrics fascinate me!!!  I have always loved this song.
11 and if you dig this vocal style, listen to "Oh Woman Oh Why, or Wild Life, or Im Down, or Helter Skelter, or Oh Darling.........pipes of steel this man has....or had
12 this song appears to be about him and linda  not giving a shit about what 'others' are saying about them...just getting high and venting it out...same with Smile Away
13 I had Alexa play songs by Paul for the dog as I went to leave. I was on my way out when I heard this start playing and I stopped dead and just HAD to listen to the whole song.
14 I have this album in the closet. Got to see Paul and Linda in 93, New World Tour. Best song ever...
15 I believe it's "a piano up my nose".
16 Imagine if he had John and George singing behind him oh my God would this be great
0 i never knew Stevie Wonder stole this song from Daft Punk
1 Better for every to lose themselves to dance then drugs, alcohol, bigotry, racism and hatred. Bring this back into our culture and make it part of our lives again.
2 The couple @1:34 are making some serious music together
3 I continuously keep choosing this one over the original Daft punk music video hahahah I know I’m not the only one.
4 What song was Stevie Wonder singing at 00:49?
5 Love this !  I never lose myself to dance ! I find Myself to dance ! What About You ? Musical Greetings !
6 I wish I had Soul like these folks.
7 At 2:43, Barry White is sho getting down,  and  Skinny Slim at 4:07
8 Black, white everyone just have fun. Music is awesome.
9 This song is more concerned about my SOUL than most churches I've been to ;)
10 Back when black culture was all about positive music and unity not guns, drugs and violence.
0 nice song bro ... chillnation is my life
1 ?this song lit ??? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?
2 first vocal feature, much love to Baynk and Chill Nation
3 Keep doing what you do, This is some of the best music I've ever heard.
4 Ooh man this song is so lit! #love_it
5 Best channel for music to listen to whilst baked :3
6 Legends say, Chill Nation will heart and Respond to this... Is it true?
7 Another cool song <3
8 Love this song
0 One of the best Bond songs ever.
1 One and only Sean Connery,Shirley Bassey at her best
2 this reminds me of my christmas panto in college =) love this song 
3 My favourite 007 theme song ever
4 this is what christina aguileras song "falling in love again I cant help it" reminds me of both CLASSIC
5 "Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld? Speak up darling I can't hear you."
6 To date, there has only been one performer who has done more than one James Bond title song.  Shirley did THREE, and a fourth that, unfortunately (in my opinion only) wasn't used.
7 i prefer the goldfinger theme. the very notion of someone other than Shirley Bassey singing a bond theme sickens me to the core.
8 man no more good movies like that anymore except the dark knight or the new bond films i hope mgm remakes this one
9 I went to see this film in Birmingham on its release.I was about 8 yrs old.I dont think i've ever been the same since!
This is a great song.
10 I grew up on James Bond. Since i was 5 I've been watching them with my family. And I miss this classical, beautiful bond, with charm and suave <3 aaaah.
11 This is a classic Bond tune but For Your Eyes Only has to be the best Bond song.
12 The best Bond song ever..beautiful voice and clever lyrics..
13 This was the very best Bond song of all time . Great lyrics and music.
14 Only Shirley Bassey (sp) can sing this song & she does it with such conviction.  Not many men can say that they have been a sex symbol, let alone still be one well into the 70's....way to go Sean!
15 Dame Shirley Bassey has such a beautiful voice !
0 This is my favorite Ramones song.
1 Probably  their  most underrated  song.
2 my favorite music is RAMONES!!!!!!!!!!!!! Garden Of Serenity
3 i was named after this song. not joking serenity's my name.

4 In the garden, outside, british tank. Am I the only one who's hearing that?
5 This music is my Garden of Serenity.
6 I've discovered this song (and band) when i watched the Osiris SUBJECT TO CHANGE skate video 10 years ago ! the part was with Dylan Rieder & Diego Bucchieri ... the feels <3
7 Songs are good ... but critics do not appreciate it.
I do not understand it .. Korean fan who likes Ramons
8 GREAT FUCKING SONG
9 banda pionera del punk rock
10 @94981745  try Poison Heart or I believe in miracles
11 most psychedelic Ramones song.
12 i started listening to the ramones in highschool when i was 16 im almost 30 now , i do have some of thire music but now i want everything they did
0 Good beat! I can imagine someone licking my ear to this!
1 My favorite waka flocks song , BUST IT  still catchy AF 
2 This and No Hands were his best songs hands down
3 Drake owns every song he gets featured on lmao
4 Waka isn't a good rapper but god this is fun to watch and so catchy. Such a chill beat to.
5 I don't even care if this song is for strippers.
6 I love drakes part so much  love him with all my heart I will love him until I die??????????
7 When this song comes on the radio or whatevr i turn into a stripper/twerker.
8 Still waiting on part two..
9 Still waiting for the English translation of this song.
0 Haunting, sad and beautiful. This is going to make a great closing track to this album.
1 Still no lonesome crowded west/this is a long drive/moon and antartica, but hey still probably the best theyve released of their newer stuff.
2 So looking forward to the new album, still dying to hear the studio version of Ansel!
3 The image doesn't look that good. It reminds me of old commercials for other shows on scify. Song is just alright.
 I don't think I'll be in a rush to buy this album.
4 so good! extremely chill song, very relaxing
5 I hope for some turntables in this album. I fucking love Heart Cooks Brain & Never Ending Math Equation.
6 love the photo! and the song!
7 I went to the VERY FIRST date of the 'Strangers To Ourselves Tour' last night! It was AMAZING! They played this song, The Best Room and The Ground Walks for the first time ever!
8 You all are awesome so many songs to give out to the fans can't wait for the the full album been stowkd on this year and you keep making it better and better for me Tour especially.
9 These comments have got to be the most intellectual back and forth on music I've seen on Youtube-- everyone should give themselves a pat on the back!
10 This song is sooo good. I had no idea
11 This song can make anybody go ahhhoohhahhhhh. I love MM.
12 I hear a bit of Mimicking Birds in this, maybe Owl Hoots.

6 From Palestine I love this song so much  ??
0 It's hard to drink beer to this song. Maybe stop headbanging  could could help. But I can't stop it.
1 I love his picking style.  He just bashes down on the strings.  He's the six string equivalent of Lemmy (RIP).
2 Definitely has a Motorhead feel to it. :)
3 Matt Pike has one of the all-time great guitar tones.

Here's hoping for another Sleep album!!
4 This is the first time I've heard this band. Definetly sounds like Motorhead. Not that that's a terrible thing.
5 this music is so sweaty
6 Sounds like a fucking machine gun going off. I am not even a big metal fan "Per se" but this band is filled with raw power.
GREAT!
7 Old school denim and beer metal
8 this song would be number one on headbangers ball. don't try to deny it.
9 This song uncontrollably grows a beard on you instantly and makes you detest wearing shirts.
10 lets roll a green one and start a revolution against those evil lairs of the new world order ! with  the christ heart
11 first song i heard from these fellas. new fan right here. I've been tearing thru all their stuff...over and over.
12 As a lover of Power Metal, I'm happy to indirectly tread into this. Pretty catchy.
0 I dig it Billy. Nicolette from Hemet Ca. My question is have you ever felt like walking away from it all and trying something new? Because the music business is unforgiving.

0 Sooo that put my preschool teacher's singing to shame.
1 I AM LIVING FOR THIS. seriously James has such a beautiful singing voice.
2 I want Jennifer Hudson to sing the dictionary next! SHE IS THAT AMAZING! <3
3 jennifer and james are so talented!and please check my performance ;)
4 So lit and her melanin is popping with that lip pie ?????
5 Nothing I find more cringe worthy than when people 'fancy sing' public domain songs. Anyone in on that? However -- this is obviously amazingly good.
6 The gospel version of If You're Happy…might sing that next Sunday ??
7 I Love Her acting.. damn she so funny, humble, good singer
They are Amazing
8 It's the gospel version of "If You're Happy And You Know It"!!! I love it!. :D
9 How such simple songs could be SO EPIC, is beyond me, but I feel incredibly fortunate to have seen that! I have a big goofy smile on my face because that was AWESOME!!!
10 I need this version of Skip to my Lou.  I love it when James and Jennifer get together.  They need to collaborate on a song for real because their voices compliment each other so well.
11 I knew James could sing, but damn! He's even better than I realized. Go James!! :D
12 I be shamed singing next to J Hud....I would be like....please excuse me while I take several seats and admire. Haha
13 And now I want Jennifer Hudson to sing Let It Go xD
14 Damn, at the end there I forgot I was listening to nursery rhymes! Kudos to James, but Jennifer can sing anything and make it sound good.
15 "Skip to My Lou" has never sounded better than as an R&B song for Jennifer Hudson.
16 I have never seen anyone put so much emotion into these songs ???
0 Loving it, best voice chops ever
1 I've been listening to this song on repeat since it was released......



While being fat in my room

3 Poor bird. It's like a 5 or 6 year old witnessing it's parents marriage collapse. And it looks like it plucked out all of its body feathers from the stress.
4 I am happy the bird is in a new home and will feel better with out all the stress of the old home she was in. 
5 I have no words, I guess my cat heard the same thing.??
6 Funny? Not really. Look at the bird's chest; the bird has been traumatized by the situation and started hurting herself :(
7 Given 5hat these birds are highly intellegent and easily stressed out, I hope the the new owners will spend lots of quiet time teaching her NEW and nicer things to say!! YIKES!!
